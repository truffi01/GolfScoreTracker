## Technical requirements: Performing
* It was somewhat difficult to find how to use CRUD in your app. I had to go into your code to find out where to see your posts. Nice work getting full CRUD!

## Creativity and Interface: Progressing
* Your app doesn't clearly say what this is about. I know what it's about because I was your team lead. There isn't a clear way to navigate it other than typing in route. 
* I encourage you to practice CSS libraries by including them in your projects. Flexbox and css grid are a good start to add complexity to your css. 

## Code Quality: Performing
* Love that it was connected with atlas! No need too seed the database
* I see a lot of work focusing on passport which is really awesome but it was more of an added bonus for this project. 

## Functionality: Performing
* No errors! 
* Navigation of your app is veery confusing. 

## Planning / Process / Submission: Progressing
* Your Readme should have a detailed description on what it is, how to use it, and set it up.
